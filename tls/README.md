# ssrv
`ssrv` is a versatile networking tool designed to enable efficient command execution across different systems. It operates as both a server and a client, facilitating remote shell access and command execution. With a focus on flexibility and control, users can specify environment variables, choose whether to allocate a pseudo-terminal, and define the socket for communication.

Key features include:

- **Multiplexed Connections**: Allows handling multiple clients simultaneously, ensuring robustness and scalability.
- **Customizable Environment Variables**: Users can pass a comma-separated list of environment variables to the server side process, providing fine-grained control over the session environment. And with the ability to specify exceptions when passing/unsetting all env vars: `-env all-:MY_VAR,MY_VAR1 -uenv all-:MY_VAR2,MY_VAR3`
- **Pseudo-Terminal Allocation**: Offers options to force or avoid allocating a pseudo-terminal, accommodating various command behaviors and client requirements.
- **Dynamically Resizing Pseudo-Terminal**: Dynamically changing the size of the pseudo-terminal along with the size of the window.
- **Command Execution**: When no command is passed, the default behavior is to spawn a shell on the server side, offering full shell functionality to the client. The remote command exit code is also returned to the client.
- **Shims for the server side binaries**: If there's a process that you always want to execute on the server side system, you can
create a symlink to it somewhere in your `$PATH` and it'll always be executed through `ssrv`.
- **Stdin Pipe**: Sends data to the command's standard input using a pipe.
- **Separate Stdout and Stderr**: The client receives stdout and stderr in a separate channels.
- **BG Control**: Client background processes control (without suspending tty output). And sending `syscall.Signal's` to client pids on server side if running without allocation pty.
- **Exit Code Forwarding**: Return the exit code to the client.
- **Setting CWD Path**: Changing the current working directory of the process/command.
- **TLS Encryption**: The ability to enable TLS encryption of connections.

`ssrv` is ideal for system administrators and developers who require a solution for executing commands remotely or locally with  listening on unix sockets. By default, the server and the client communicate via an abstract unix socket `@ssrv`. Its configurability and support for multiple concurrent sessions make it suitable for complex network operations and management tasks.

## To get started:
* **Build the latest revision**
```
git clone https://github.com/VHSgunzo/ssrv.git
cd ssrv/tls
./build.sh
./build/$(uname -m)/ssrv -h
```
* Or take an already precompiled binary file from the [releases](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/ssrv/releases)


## **Usage**:
```
┌──[user@linux]─[~] - generate key.pem and cert.pem:
└──╼ $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
┌──[user@linux]─[~] - Server:
└──╼ $ ssrv -srv [-tls-key key.pem] [-tls-cert cert.pem] [-sock tcp:1337] [-env all]
┌──[user@linux]─[~] - Client:
└──╼ $ ssrv [-tls-cert cert.pem] [options] [ COMMAND [ arguments... ] ]

If COMMAND is not passed, spawn a $SHELL on the server side.

Accepted options:
    -cpids-dir string
        A directory on the server side for storing a list of client PIDs. (default "/tmp/ssrv$EUID"))
    -cwd string
        Change the current working directory of the process/command.
    -env string
        Comma separated list of environment variables to pass to the server side process. (default "TERM")
    -env-pids string
        Comma separated list of PIDs for get environment variables for pass to the server side process.
    -no-pty
        Do not allocate a pseudo-terminal for the server side process
    -nosep-cpids
        Don't create a separate dir for the server socket to store the list of client PIDs.
    -pid-file string
        The file for storing the server's PID.
    -pty
        Force allocate a pseudo-terminal for the server side process
    -srv
        Run as server
    -sock string
        Socket address listen/connect (unix,tcp,tcp4,tcp6) (default "unix:@ssrv")
    -tls-cert string
        TLS cert file for server and client (default "cert.pem")
    -tls-key string
        TLS key file for server (default "key.pem")
    -uenv string
        Comma separated list of environment variables for unset on the server side process.
    -v
        Show this program's version

Environment variables:
    SSRV_PTY=1                      Same as -pty argument
    SSRV_NO_PTY=1                   Same as -no-pty argument
    SSRV_ENV_PIDS="123,456"         Same as -env-pids argument

    SSRV_TLS_CERT="/path/cert.pem"  Same as -tls-cert argument
    SSRV_CPIDS_DIR=/path/dir        Same as -cpids-dir argument
    SSRV_NOSEP_CPIDS=1              Same as -nosep-cpids argument
    SSRV_PID_FILE=/path/ssrv.pid    Same as -pid-file argument
    SSRV_CWD=/path/dir              Same as -cwd argument
    SHELL="/bin/bash"               Assigns a default shell (on the server side)

If none of the pty arguments are passed in the client, a pseudo-terminal is allocated by default, unless it is
known that the command behaves incorrectly when attached to the pty or the client is not running in the terminal
```

Example of creating a shim for the `flatpak` command:

```
# Inside your container:

$ flatpak --version
zsh: command not found: flatpak

# Have ssrv handle any flatpak command
$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/ssrv /usr/local/bin/flatpak

# Now flatpak will always be executed on the server side
$ flatpak --version
Flatpak 1.12.7
```
**Note:** you will want to store the symlink in a location visible only to the container, to avoid an infinite loop. If you are using toolbox/distrobox, this means anywhere outside your home directory. I recommend `/usr/local/bin`.

Example of file transfer to server:

```
# one file:
ssrv sh -c 'cat>/server/path/some_file.tar.zst' </client/path/some_file.tar.zst

# directory with zstd compression:
tar -I 'zstd -T0 -1' -c /client/path/some_dir|ssrv tar --zstd -xf - -C /server/path/some_dir
```

Example of file transfer from server:

```
# one file:
ssrv cat /server/path/some_file.tar.zst > /client/path/some_file.tar.zst

# directory with zstd compression:
ssrv tar -I 'zstd -T0 -1' -c /server/path/some_dir|tar --zstd -xf - -C /client/path/some_dir
# or dir to archive:
ssrv tar -I 'zstd -T0 -1' -c /server/path/some_dir > /client/path/some_dir.tar.zst
```
